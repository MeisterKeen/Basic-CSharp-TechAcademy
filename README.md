# C# Projects

#### This is a repository of the projects I created while I was learning the basics of C#, .NET, EntityFramework and related technologies!

## Tutorial Demos

In this folder you'll find a long list of console applications and basic web applicatons that I put together to demonstrate various basics of C# syntax and capabilities. All of these were built in Visual Studio, using .NET Framework.

## Car Insurance

This is an MVC application that takes in a list of inputs from a user and outputs a car insurance quote. It uses a database-first EntityFramework implementation to store user inputs and give back curated lists of records.

## [Twenty One](https://github.com/MeisterKeen/Basic-CSharp-TechAcademy/tree/main/Guided%20Projects/TwentyOne)

This is a game of blackjack! This was a guided project where I built a full game of twenty-one, complete with user balance, bets and a Vegas-compliant dealer.

## Assignments

In this folder you'll find projects where I was given a problem to solve, and little guidance as to how to solve it. I set these apart, as each one was a case where I had to prove that I was able to apply what I'd learned and come up with my own implementation.
